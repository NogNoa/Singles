"""Designed and programmed by chris gaylo, syosset H.S.~~9/12/70
This so called port from early BASIC to Python by Omer Dassa ~~24/02/20
Some things were made simpler and or readable, 
but the intention was to stay relatively close to the original code.
number comments are original BASIC line numbers,
as original uses goto commands
